# Memory Game

A game that will test your memory. The game has hidden color
cards that you must uncover by clicking them. The game will only show you
one color at a time to increase difficulty.

## Getting Started

Start clicking any card to uncover the color. The second card will only
uncover if it's a match otherwise your currently uncovered card becomes
hidden again.

The cards will stay uncovered if you matches.

You will when you uncover all 16 cards.

At any point you can press reset button to reshuffle cards and start
again.

Do you want to try it out?
